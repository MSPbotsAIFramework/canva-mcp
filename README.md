# canva-mcp

MCP server that lets Agent-platform tenants browse, create, export, and manage
Canva designs and assets through [Canva's Connect API](https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/).

- **Transport**: MCP Streamable HTTP (`POST /mcp`), stateless.
- **Stack**: Python 3.12, `mcp` (FastMCP), `httpx`.
- **License**: Apache-2.0.

This service never performs Canva's OAuth authorization flow itself. It expects
an already-valid Canva OAuth access token on every request (see
[Authentication headers](#authentication-headers)) and forwards it straight
through to Canva as a Bearer token. Obtaining and refreshing that token is the
job of whichever platform component issues the Header to this service.

## MSPbots Connector

**The MCP Gateway built for MSPs: visible, controlled, and your data stays where it belongs.**

[**Get started at connect.mspbots.ai →**](https://connect.mspbots.ai)

MSPbots Connector gives your AI clients one MCP URL to reach your entire MSP stack (RMM, PSA, documentation, security, finance), and gives you control over who can call which tool and a record of everything that was called.

**Hosted service: [connect.mspbots.ai](https://connect.mspbots.ai)** · Free to use.

### Why Connector

![MSPbots Connector](https://stgoss.mspbots.ai/files/mcp/mspbots-mcp.png)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Visible** | Every tool call is logged: who, which vendor, when. Usage dashboard, CSV export, SIEM streaming. |
| **Controlled** | Role-based, per-tool allowlist. Deny by default. |
| **Protected** | Credentials encrypted per record. AI clients never see your vendor passwords or tokens. |
| **MSP-native** | Built for the MSP stack only: RMM, PSA, documentation, security, finance. |

### Quick start

1. **Sign up** at [connect.mspbots.ai](https://connect.mspbots.ai).
2. **Connect your vendors.** Pick from 150+ connectors and authorize each one on the vendor's own page, or bring your own API keys. No extra vendor accounts needed.
3. **Set access.** Create roles and decide which tools each role may call. Nothing is allowed until you allow it.
4. **Add your MCP URL to your AI client.** Copy the URL from your Connector dashboard into Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, Gemini, Codex, or any MCP-capable client.
5. **Ask your AI to do real work**, and watch every call appear in the audit log.

### Features

**Unified gateway**
- One MCP URL for all your AI clients
- 150+ connectors across the MSP stack
- Custom MCP servers supported, free
- Authorization happens on each vendor's own page; the AI never sees passwords or tokens
- Bring your own credentials: use the vendor API keys you already have
- Multiple accounts per app; connect once, reuse across AI clients
- Tool search: finds the right action for the task
- One sign-in; vendor credentials are injected behind the scenes and OAuth tokens refresh automatically

**Visibility**
- Audit log for every tool call (who, which vendor, when)
- Usage dashboard: call volume, top vendors, error rate, per-user activity
- Export audit logs to CSV, or stream to Loki, Graylog, or LogScale (SIEM)
- Optional recording of tool arguments and result summaries (off by default, enabled per organization)

**Control**
- Per-role, per-tool allowlist, deny by default
- owner / admin / member roles
- SCIM provisioning with Entra ID, Okta, JumpCloud, and Google Workspace

**Security**
- Credentials encrypted one record at a time (AES-256-GCM, per-record key)
- AI clients authenticate with OAuth 2.1 + PKCE
- Vendor responses are scanned for prompt-injection patterns and returned as structured data. This is one layer of defense, not a guarantee against every attack.
- Static egress IP for customer firewall and API allowlisting

### Pricing

**Free.**

## Authentication headers

| Header | Required | Meaning | Where to obtain it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Canva-Access-Token` | Yes | A valid Canva Connect API OAuth access token (Bearer token), already obtained and refreshed elsewhere in the platform. This service does not perform the OAuth flow itself. | Canva Developer Portal → your app → Connect API credentials, via the OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE flow (`https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/authentication/`) |

Requests missing this header get `401` with a body naming the missing header.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canva_get_user_profile` | Display name of the connected Canva account; use first to confirm the connection. |
| `canva_list_designs` | List the account's designs, with search and pagination. |
| `canva_get_design` | Get a design's metadata (title, page count, thumbnail, edit/view URLs). |
| `canva_create_design` | Create a new, empty design of a given type. |
| `canva_export_design` | Export a design to a file (pdf/png/jpg/pptx/gif/mp4/csv) and get download URLs. |
| `canva_get_export_status` | Poll the status of an export job. |
| `canva_upload_asset_from_url` | Upload a publicly reachable image/video URL as a new asset. |
| `canva_get_asset` | Get an asset's metadata. |
| `canva_list_folder_items` | List the contents of a folder (including the root Projects folder and the Uploads folder). |

Not in v1: editing design content (Canva's Connect API does not expose
element-level editing), Comments, Autofill, Brand Templates, Analytics,
direct binary asset upload, and deleting or updating existing designs/assets.
See `docs/tickets/PRD-21299.md` for the full design, including why.

## Running locally

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m canva_mcp
# or: docker compose up --build
```

Then, with a placeholder (well-formed but fake) token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H 'X-Canva-Access-Token: placeholder-token' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

## Tests

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
```
